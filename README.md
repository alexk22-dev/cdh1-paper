# Abstract

The CDH1 gene and its corresponding protein, E-cadherin, are essential in cell-cell adhesion and signaling pathways, such as Wnt/Î²-catenin and PI3K/Akt. They are mildly dysregulated in breast cancer. Here, a bioinformatic analysis of genomic and proteomic data on breast cancer patients was performed. Initial bioinformatic analysis was performed with web-based portals such as cBioPortal and STRING db. Then, genomic and proteomic data were compared using DepMap and UALCAN. A statistical analysis to determine significant differences between expression data was performed with R software. A mildly significant statistical difference was determined between CDH1 and EGFR gene expression in breast invasive ductal carcinoma (non-overlapping 95% CI), and statistically significant differences in CDH1 protein expression were identified between primary tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, stage 2 and stage 3 breast cancer compared to normal tissue, and luminal and HER2-positive breast cancer compared to normal tissue. This study provides further evidence to support CDH1 as a tumor suppressor gene in early breast cancer stages and suggests that CDH1 may play a more oncogenic role in late-stage breast cancer. However, further validation is warranted.
